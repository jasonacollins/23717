# 3.3 Probability distributions

Imagine we have an urn full of balls. On each ball is written a number. If you knew how many balls there were and the value written on every ball, you could write a mathematical function giving the probability that you would pull out any particular value. That mathematical function is the probability distribution.

Another example of a probability distribution is a function to describe the result of rolling a dice. The probability distribution is a 1 in 6 chance of rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.

## The normal distribution

The most famous probability distribution is the "normal distribution".

The normal distribution is a probability distribution for a continuous variable. It is described by just two parameters: the mean and standard deviation. As you can see from the shape of the distribution, the normal distribution is sometimes called the bell curve.

The way to look at this distribution is that the area under the curve between any two points on the x-axis represents the probability of a draw of a variable from a population falling in that area. This particular curve has a mean of zero and standard deviation of 1. The standard deviations are marked along the bottom.

Approximately 50% of the mass of a normal distribution falls within 0.67 standard deviations of the mean. 68% is within one standard deviation and 95% within two standard deviations. This means that if I drew random numbers from this normal distribution, 68% would be between -1 and 1, and 95% would be between -2 and 2.

Many natural phenomena approximate normal distributions. For example, human height is roughly normally distributed. Males are on average 5'10" with a standard deviation of 4 inches, and women 5'5" with a standard deviation of 3.5 inches. (This obviously varies across countries etc.) As a result, we can say that 95% of men are between 5'2" and 6'6", and 95% of women are between 4'10" and 6'0".

Normal distributions are valuable to us in this course as the properties of many of the variables conform to a normal distribution. For example, suppose we conduct an experiment many times, each time getting a mean of the observed values. Each time that mean will vary slightly by chance. The distribution of that mean will approximate a normal distribution.

## Student's t-distribution

An almost equally famous distribution, at least in statistical circles, is Student's t-distribution. It is used in statistical tests instead of the normal distribution when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small.

The student's distribution resembles a normal distribution, but has heavier tails, which means that more extreme results are more probable. As the sample size increases, the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution. For large sample sizes, they are practically equivalent.
