# 3.2 Hypothesis testing

In a behavioural science trial, there are always at least two hypotheses: the intervention works or it doesn't. We often have more.

Hypothesis testing is a form of statistical inference to differentiate between hypotheses. It doesn't answer the questions conclusively, but provides a routine for us to proceed.

# Null and alternative hypotheses

One of our hypotheses is the **null hypothesis**. This is the hypothesis that there is no difference between the two interventions (or for other types of trials, whatever the measured phenomena of interest is). In statistics, the null hypothesis is often denoted as $H_0$.

The other hypothesis (or hypotheses) is the **alternative hypothesis**. This is the position that there is a difference between the interventions and is typically consistent with the research hypotheses that led you to develop the intervention. The alternative hypothesis is often denoted as $H_1$.

The aim of hypothesis testing is to see if we can (depending on the paradigm used) either reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis, or to distinguish between the two.
