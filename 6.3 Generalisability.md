# 6.3 Generalisability

A term often used in substitute of validity, particularly external validity, is generalisability. The term is most commonly used when describing whether the results of a field trial can be taken to inform how an intervention might work in another context or at scale.

There are limited systematic evaluations of the generalisability of applied behavioural science trials. However, research on the generalisability of impact evaluations in a development context provide insight into this question.

Eva Vivalt reviewed 635 papers containing 15,024 estimates of effect sizes relating to 20 types of interventions in international development. In her paper, she assessed the extent the results from a particular intervention could be used to predict the sign of the effect or the magnitude of the effect of a similar study in another context. This question is effectively an examination of the Type M and Type S errors we discussed in week 5 [ADD LINK]

She found that an inference about a study's effect using another similar study will have the correct sign 61% of the time (comparing the median intervention-outcome pair in each study). When comparing effects, a naive prediction of the result in the new study is likely to be wrong by about 249%.
