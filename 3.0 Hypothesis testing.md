# 3.0 Hypothesis testing

Imagine conducting a randomised controlled trial to test an intervention designed to increase on-time submission of tax returns. You have a hypothesis that social norms can improve submission outcomes. You randomise citizens into two groups, one of which receives a standardised reminder, the other a reminder with a social norm pointing out that 90% of other people in their suburb submit their return on time.

Suppose we then repeat the experiment on a new group of subjects. And then another.

Across each of our repeats of the experiment, the precise results will almost surely not be repeated. Each time there will be measurement variability, environmental variability, variation in the application of the treatment (e.g. did we have less correct email addresses), variation between the subjects in each experiment, and so on. The result is that the intervention will appear more effective in some experiments than others simply through chance.

Hypothesis testing provides a statistical method(s) to infer whether differences between interventions in an experiment are a chance event or the result of a substantive difference in the effectiveness of the interventions. In this week's material we will examine some of the approaches to hypothesis testing, the statistical concepts that we will use, and how "statistical significance" can act as a filter for our hypotheses.
