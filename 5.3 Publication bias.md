# 5.3 Publication bias

Recall from earlier in this unit [Link to page 3.6] Daryl Bem's article claiming that participants in his experiments had ESP. The experimental participants were able to detect "erotic" images behind curtains at a probability better than chance.

Would Bem's research have been published in a top psychology journal if he had not obtained a statistically significant result? Would the journal waste its resources publishing a paper suggesting people do not have ESP?

This point is the essence of publication bias. Publication bias occurs where the outcome of an experiment influences whether it is published or not.

Studies that find significant effects are more likely to be published. This incentivises those conducting experiments to only write up their positive results. Studies that do not generate statistically significant results end up in the file drawer. Ultimately, the published literature ceases to be a representative sample of the evidence. Instead, it is biased.

## Analysis to identify publication bias

While it is easy to see the incentives that might generate publication bias, measuring publication bias is more difficult and sometimes controversial.

One common way is through the use of a funnel plot, which is used to analyse for publication bias across a literature. The effect sizes of all experiments examining a particular intervention are plotted against the precision of the studies. Precision is usually proxied by study size or the standard error.

A literature in which all experimental results are published should see a spread of results around the effect size, with smaller or less precise studies having more variation around that point. This results in a funnel shape of results, as in the first diagram.

Where there is publication bias, there is often an assymmetry in that the results on one side of the funnel plot (typically the small sample studies that delivered results in the unintended direction) are missing.

Asymmetric funnel plots are not definitive of publication bias, and rest on several assumptions such as a lack of systematic link between size of effect and size of study (which there may be if people use a larger sample because they believe the effect is small). 

## Remedying publication bias

A primary method proposed for reducing publication bias is the use of pre-registration. This provides a basis for understanding the full scope of the studies that have been undertaken.

However, this is not a complete remedy as many pre-registered studies are not published and their results not available. That prevents us from obtaining a complete view of the experiments that have been conducted.
