# Module 1 overview

# Introduction

This module will span the first week of this unit. During this week, we will examine the foundations of the use of experiments to understand behavioural phenomena (and in fact, phenomena across the sciences). We will learn about what why we should experiment and some types of experiments. We will also foreshadow some of the considerations in designing an experiment that we will examine through this unit.

By the end of this module,  you will be able to answer the following questions:

    1. What is an experiment?
    2. Why do we run experiments?
    3. What are the different types of experiments?
    4. What are some of the elements of experimental design?
