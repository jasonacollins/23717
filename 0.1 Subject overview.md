# Subject overview

In this unit, we study the principles and method of experimental research. You will learn the theory and good practices to design experiments in the field and test hypotheses. We will review confounds which can appear in an experimental study and how to ensure that an experimental project delivers the right insights. We will also examine the generalisability of experiments and how we should review the existing experimental literature.

The unit is organised into three main modules:

- **Module 1 - Introduction**: What is a trial? Why do we run experiments? What are the different types of experiments?
- **Module 2 - Running a trial**: What is a randomised controlled trial? What are the steps in a trial? How do we develop and test hypotheses? How do we design our sampling and analysis plans?
- **Module 3 - Scaling and replication**: What is external and internal validity? Do experiments generalise? What is the "replication crisis"? How should I interpret the existing experimental literature?
