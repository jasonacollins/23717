# 6.0 Implementation and scaling

The front and back end of applied behavioural science trials have discrete challenges.

Before a trial, there is a need to get the organisation to buy into the trial and execute the experiment. Many proposed experiments have been scuttled by a failure to accept experimentation as a way of determining what works, by running into organisational barriers or by changes in priorities. 

After a trial, the challenge comes in what to do next. You want to implement the findings at scale, but to what extent will the results of your trial (or other trials) generalise when scaled or implemented in a new context.

In this week's material, we will look at these dual challenges of getting trials up and applying the findings at scale.
