# 2.4 Developing an intervention for trial

Applied behavioural science projects are typically designed to change behaviour (or at least to improve an outcome caused by a certain behaviour). The trial is one step of that project.

Through that project, you will ask many questions that will inform the interventions that you wish to trial. For instance, your sequence of questions might be:

- What is the problem you are trying to solve?
- What behaviour is leading to the outcome?
- What is our theory of the current behaviour?
- What interventions might influence the behaviour?

You might answer those questions through process such as that described in Module 1 [add link to page 1.4]. Once you have answered them, you will have a shortlist of interventions that you could trial. The purpose of the trial is to differentiate between the effectiveness of those behavioural interventions. Are any of the interventions more effective in improving your outcome of interest?

There are some other practical questions you need to ask in selecting interventions for trial.

First, you want the choice of interventions to help answer an interesting question. You want to learn something. For example, has the intervention been found effective or ineffective in similar contexts before? Will you learn something new from trying it again? If text message reminders have been found consistently effective in similar scenarios, a test of text messages versus a control of no message may not be informative. However, a trial varying the content of the message and the theoretical underpinning of that message might be.

Second, you want to select interventions that you can deliver consistently at scale. For the experiment, you want everyone within each group (control and treatments) to receive the same interventions as others in the group. But more importantly, what would happen if your trial was successful? What will it practically look like at scale relative to your perfect world conception of the intervention? If you have found an intervention to be highly effective, but it is not feasible to roll out at scale, your experiment is not useful.

The process of selecting interventions for an applied behavioural science trial is usually conceptually simpler than developing interventions for an academic experiment designed to test a theory. In that case, it is important that there is not a confounding theory that gives an equally plausible rationale for the behaviour observed in the experiment. The experimenter needs to understand the most plausible hypotheses that should be controlled for, which might depend on recent developments in theory. An experiment may only appear good at the time, as subsequent work may expose its theoretical flaws.

But that is not to say that you shouldn't think about the conceptual and theoretical underpinnings of your interventions in an applied behavioural science trial. There will typically be a theoretical basis for your choice of interventions. That basis will help determine what you should measure. It will inform the interpretation of your results. It can provide the foundation for you to take those interventions into other contexts.
