# 2.0 Trial basics

A good experiment tends to have a number of design features. These include that:

- Your trial is simple
- Your trial is designed to test specific hypothesis or hypotheses
- Your trial is designed to test or controls for alternative hypotheses.

In the first week of this module, we will look at the basic structure of a trial that has these features. We will look at the concept of control and how this is implemented in randomised controlled trials. We will examine how to develop a question and how to measure trial outcomes.

We will also cover another important consideration at the beginning of any trial, ethics.
