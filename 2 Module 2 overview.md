# Module 2 overview

## Running a trial

This module will span approximately 3 weeks. During the first week, we will examine the foundation piece of most experiments, the randomised controlled trial. In the second, we will examine the mechanics of testing a hypothesis in a randomised controlled trial. And in the third, we will examine how to arrange the samples required to test your hypothesis.

For this module, we are largely going to consider trials for public policy or business applications, in the lab or field, rather than for academic purposes. Many of the principles hold across academic, business and policy settings (in fact, they are often the same as a trial may involve both an academic and a business or policy question), but focusing our attention to the applied behavioural science question will allow us to achieve more depth.

By the end of this module,Â  you will be able to answer the following questions:

1. What is a randomised controlled trial?
2. What ethical principles should guide our trial design?
3. What are the features of a good experimental question?
4. How can we develop and test a hypothesis in a randomised controlled trial?
5. What sample arrangement will enable a sound test of your hypothesis?
