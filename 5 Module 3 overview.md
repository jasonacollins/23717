# 5 Module 3 overview

## Replication and implementation

This module will span approximately 2 weeks. During the first week, we will examine how to interpret trial results. This examination will largely be through the lens of replication, which concerns whether the same trial run twice will generate the same results. In the second week we will examine the challenges of implementation: what happens when we scale trial results or move them into a new context, and how do we get organisational buy-in to run experiments.

By the end of this module, you will be able to answer the following questions:

1. What is the replication crisis?
2. How have publication bias and researcher degrees of freedom contributed to the replication crisis?
3. What are Type S and Type M errors?
4. What are internal and external validity?
5. How generalisable are trials to new contexts?
6. What are the conditions to get organisational buy-in to experimentation?
