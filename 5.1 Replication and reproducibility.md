# 5.1 Replication and reproducibility

**Reproducibility** is the ability of a different analyst to re-perform the same analysis of experimental data.

**Reproducible research** is research that provides the full materials require to reproduce academic research. It includes features such as the code and data that was used and details on the computational environment in which it was examined.

**Replication** is the ability to re-perform the experiment and collect new data. An experiment is said to replicate if it returns a similar result.

These two terms are sometimes used interchangeably, so their precise names don't matter, but the two distinct concepts do.

# Reproducibility

Even with the same data, people can come to different conclusions about the hypotheses.

They can transform the data in different ways. They can use different tests for the hypotheses. There are many possible analytic approaches. The result is that experimental data does not in itself provide the conclusion. Absent reproducible research, it is not clear what choices were made and the effect of those choices on the conclusion cannot be examined.

As one dramatic illustration involved an analysis of data to see whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark-skinned players than to light-skinned players. Twenty-nine analyst teams were tasked with answering this question. They found effect sizes ranging from 0.89 (dark-skinned players receive fewer) to 2.93 (dark-skinned players receive almost three times as many). Twenty of the 29 teams found a statistically significant positive effect, with the other nine failing to find a statistically significant relationship.

We will examine replication on the next page.
