# 3.1 Statistical approaches

Although we want to determine a "truth" about the interventions we have developed and which of our hypotheses hold, there are different ways in statistics to reach this truth. We can use different tools to design our experiment and analyse our experimental data.

We are not going to examine all of these alternatives in depth, but here are three major approaches:

**Frequentist statistics** provides a set of rules for when we should reject a null hypothesis. This approach won't give you the right answer for every single test, but in the long-run you will be correct a certain percentage of the time (and you get to set that percentage).

**Likelihoods** tell you the likelihood of different hypotheses given the data that you have collected.

**Bayesian statistics** is built on the idea of prior beliefs. You won't just look at the data you have collected. You will also consider your prior beliefs and consider how much you should update your beliefs given the data. This then gives you a "posterior belief" as to the probability that the hypothesis is true.

There is a large scientific debate between the adherents to these different approaches. However, with the exception of a brief sojourn into Bayesian statistics, we will focus on the frequentist approach for the rest of this unit. It is the most common approach in academic and applied behavioural science, and understanding this paradigm will enable you to engage with most of the academic literature.
