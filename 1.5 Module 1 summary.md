# Module 1 summary

In this module, we have examined why we experiment, the role of experiments, the various types of experiments and where they may fit in a broader project.

Before you start module 2, (optionally) listen to Nobel Memorial Prize winner and pioneer of lab experimentation in economics, Vernon Smith, interviewed by Russ Roberts on EconTalk.
