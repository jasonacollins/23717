# 3.6 Bayesian hypothesis testing

Although we will focus on the frequentist paradigm through this unit, the Bayesian framework does provide a useful angle to think about many of the controversies in behavioural science.

Bayesian statistics is built on the idea of prior beliefs. In the frequentist approach to hypothesis testing we have just explored, the analysis only uses data you have sampled in your experiment. It does not draw on other data.

The Bayesian approach starts with a prior belief: that we know prior probabilities of $H_0$ and $H_1$. We then observe the data: taking a sample. As we know what we expect the data to look like under each of our two hypotheses, we can then update our probabilities based on these new data. If it conforms more to one hypothesis than the other, we can shift our probabilities in that direction.

This approach is operationlised through the classic Bayes formula:

$P(A|B)=P(B|A)\frac{P(A)}{P(B)}$

The probability of A given B is equal to the probability of B given A multiplied by the relative likelihood of A and B.

In terms of our hypotheses, we would use this formula to calculate the "posterior" probability of the null hypothesis being true given the data we have seen. It is equal to the probability of seeing the data given the null hypothesis is true, multiplied by the probability of the hypothesis being true, divided by the probability of seeing the data.

$P(H_0|data)=P(data|H_0)\frac{P(H_0)}{P(data)}$

We can do the same for $H_1$.

# Discussion

In 2011 the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (a big, flagship journal) published a paper by Daryl Bem entitled "Feeling the Future: Experimental Evidence of Anomalous Retroactive Influences on Cognition and Affect."

In the paper Bem described nine experiments. In the first experiment, participants were shown pictures of two curtains side-by-side on a screen. One of them had a picture behind it, the other a blank wall. The participants were asked to click on the curtain that they felt had the picture behind it. They were then shown if they had selected the correct curtain.

Some of the pictures shown to the participants were "erotic". Where there was an erotic picture, participants selected the pictures more often than expected by chance: 53.1% of the time. For non-erotic pictures, the probability of success did not vary significantly from chance. The p-value for selecting the erotic pictures was 0.01, a significant result.

The combination of nine experiments with "statistically significant" results and p-values below 0.05 enabled the paper to make it through the peer review process and to be accepted for publication.

Think about this problem from a Bayesian perspective. How might that change the conclusion? HINT: What is the prior probability of $H_0$ and $H_1$.
